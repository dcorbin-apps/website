		<h1> Fast First for Android, Upgrading from 1.0 to 2.0</h1>

		<div class="question">Does this apply to me? </div>

		<p>Did you back this project on Kickstarter?</p>
		<p>
		<b>Yes:</b> You should have received an email about how to get the app from
			the Google Play Store at no charge.
		If you did not, you may reach out to me at the email address at the end of this FAQ.
			The rest of this FAQ does not apply to you.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>No:</b> Continue reading the FAQ.
		</p>

		<div class="question">How do I upgrade?</div>

		<p>
		There is no direct upgrade path.  You will have to install the new version
			and manually remove the old version. (Or not, but you might confuse the two
			if you don't).
		</p>
		<div class="question">Why is there no direct upgrade path?</div>
		<p>
		    Technical decisions made by Google, my failure to understand them,
			and my failure to keep a copy of the signing key used when the app
			was first made all worked together.  New features for publishers offered in the
			Google Play Store should  prevent a recurrence.
		</p>

		<div class="question">Are you trying to get me to pay twice? </div>
		<p>
		No.  I deeply regret this problem and value you as a customer.  I spent many,
			many hours digging through backups and working with Google Play support to see
			if there was a way to work past this, and regrettably I have failed.
			To that end, I am instituting the following policy:
		</p>
		<div class="quote">
		   If you email to me a non-pubic link to the original (v1.0.1) .apk file for
			Fast First within 90 days of the release of the replacement (v2.0),
			I will send you a code that should give you free access to the new replacement
			in the Google Play Store.   The email should contain "UPGRADE" in the subject.

			<b>Please note:</b>  if I determine abuse of this
			process is occurring, I reserve the right to terminate this offer at any time.
		</div>
		<p>
		I recommend Google Drive as an easy way to send me a link.
